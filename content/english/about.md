My previous blogging efforts focused solely on the ServiceNow platform, and while I may incorporate ServiceNow as a topic in this blog, it is not solely the intent. I hope to make this more a of a technical learning blog when it comes to React, etc. but I may even venture out to more personal topics such as fitness and cooking. 

A little bit about myself professionally:

I've been working on the ServiceNow platform for over 6 years. I've worked in industries such as Higher Education, Healthcare, and Consulting. I've touched mostly all core areas of the platform, and can pretty much figure out a new application or feature if needed. I've gotten some certifications along the way and find that challenging myself for a certification test is a great way to learn material, but they shouldn't be solely relied on for career development.

I'm a big proponent of education, and don't subscribe to the 'you don't need a degree to be in IT' mentality, everyone needs a well rounded view of the world and the skills to think critically. I find that most of the voices that seem to be behind this effort aren't very diverse, and probably don't unerstand how hard it is for some people to get their foot into the door without a degree. That being said, I don't support taking out a mortgage to get a degree, there is a balance between getting an education and an affordable one. My first degree taught me the most, and my second degree helped me reinforce my place in the IT field, but isn't a replacement for lifelong learning and a growth mindset.

On a personal note:

I've gotten into triahlon races in the past 2 years, and enjoy challenging myself. When I'm not at work, more than likely I am outside running, biking, or some other activity and not on the computer. I'm training for a half marathon and hope to knock that out in November 2022. I've come from only being able to run about 2 miles to training for 13 miles in about 2 months, a real Forrest Gump moment, but it really just comes down to putting the time in and getting your nutrition and mindset right.

I enjoy reading about all kinds of subjects, from Bonobos to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Here are some of my favorite podcasts:
