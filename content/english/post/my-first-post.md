Thanks for stopping by to check out my new blog. Previously, I had a blog that was solely focused on ServiceNow (ashleysn.com - no longer active), and I may incorporate some of that here, but this blog is going to be more technical project and learning focused. I hope to document my React journey, as well as have a space for fitness and lifestyle posts. If I do incorporate some ServiceNow material, it will be 'unofficial' content, and really just my thoughts and exploration of things.

I went out on a limb and created this blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) instead of Wix (because I was tired of paying for Wix) and I've found Hugo really simple to use. I'll probably hook up a domain at some point, but just wanted to play around with Hugo and GitHub Pages to see how this thing would work out. 

I found the [Anatole](https://github.com/lxndrblz/anatole) theme pretty easy to use and configure and have enjoyed learning about the various config files and post structure. I've been wanting to do more with [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files as of late, which is another reason I decided to start up this blog, so you may see some Markdown related posts here as well. 

I'll post as I have the time and desire to, and will probably begin with a series of posts on learning React. Thanks again for reading!
